/// player's swing becomes on the host. `Dam_EnemyDamageBase.ReceiveMeleeDamage(pFullDamageData)` is the master-side
/// packet receiver (the method is `protected`, so it is patched by name), and the packet carries the attacker
/// (`pAgent source`, resolved through its own `TryGet`), the limb (`byte limbID`) and the gear category — but not
/// the charge, and its damage field is a packed `UFloat16` whose decode scale belongs to the receiver's own body.
/// The damage this half publishes is therefore not decoded out of the packet: it is the receiver's own health
/// before and after the body ran, which is the damage that really landed, and a hit the receiver's rules reduced
/// to nothing publishes nothing at all.
///
/// Who publishes what is `MeleeHitLedger`'s rule: this half publishes only for an attacker that is neither this
/// machine's own player nor a bot, because those two swings are already published by the hit entries themselves
/// (`WeaponMeleeHitFacts`), and the shared ledger keeps a hit from being published twice if a packet arrives twice.
/// A swing whose attacker this process cannot name as a player publishes nothing and says so.
///
/// The hooks are read-only with respect to the game: they read the receiver's health around a body the game is
/// already running and never touch that body's arguments or result.</summary>

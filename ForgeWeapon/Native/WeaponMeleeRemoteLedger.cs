/// <summary>The rule that keeps `forge.trigger.combat.melee_hit` published once per landed hit even though the row
/// has two native sources. Both halves are game-independent on purpose: which source may publish, and which hit
/// has already been published, are decisions this package can be held to without a game in the process.
///
/// <b>Which source publishes.</b> The row is written by the machine that performs the swing
/// (`MeleeWeaponFirstPerson.DoAttackDamage` for its own player, `MeleeWeaponThirdPerson.DoAttackDamage` for a bot
/// it replays) and, on the host, by the replicated damage a remote client's swing becomes
/// (`Dam_EnemyDamageBase.ReceiveMeleeDamage`). Those three overlap on exactly one machine — the host runs both its
/// own hit entry and the receive body for its own player's swing, because the game sends the damage to itself —
/// so the receive half publishes only for an attacker that is neither this machine's own player nor a bot. The
/// other two are already published by their own hooks, and a hit whose attacker is one of them is not this half's
/// to publish.
///
/// <b>Which hit has already been published.</b> The ledger is the second half of the same rule: a hit is claimed by
/// the source that publishes it, and a claim is live for a short window, so a packet the network delivers twice —
/// or a receive body reached twice for one swing — publishes once. A claim is keyed by the attacker, the target
/// and the limb, because that triple is what one landed hit is; a second swing at the same limb a moment later is
/// a different hit and is claimed again once the window has passed. The world epoch is part of the ledger's own
/// state, so a claim can never outlive the world it was made in.</summary>

/// The holder-client command channel: the one thing this slice has to add to the runtime for
/// <see cref="WeaponHolderActionsContract"/>'s two rows to be executable at all.
///
/// The kernel dispatches a command on the machine that owns the world, and until now the only tier that ran a
/// handler somewhere else was `presentation` — and that tier refuses a committing result by design, because it
/// writes a screen. A reload is the opposite case: it is a real world write whose correct machine is the holder's
/// client, not the host. The channel is therefore one tier, `owner`, with three parts:
///
/// <list type="number">
/// <item>the host walks an `owner` step the way it walks a presentation step — it resolves the step's inputs,
/// decides the timing, and records an intent instead of invoking a handler;</item>
/// <item>the intent travels as the same `CommandRequest` message the presentation tier already uses, marked with
/// its own node index, addressed to the holder's session;</item>
/// <item>the holder executes it through a kernel entry point that is <see cref="RuntimeKernel"/>'s own handler
/// invocation, with <c>IsHost</c> false, but <b>without</b> the presentation tier's no-commit rule: the write
/// really happens there, and the facts it publishes travel back through the ordinary fact channel.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// Who the holder is, is the provider's own answer, not the kernel's guess: this module registers one session
/// resolver per `owner` capability of its own (the runtime's <c>OwnerSessions</c> table, the same ownership rule
/// the presentation tier's recipient resolver follows), and a step whose holder cannot be named is refused with
/// <see cref="NoHolderCode"/> rather than sent to an implicit everyone.
///
/// This file is the contract half: the provider identity, the row ids and the refusal codes the two halves share.
/// The native half (<c>Native/WeaponHolderChannel.cs</c>) is the one that reads a session out of a player
/// reference and performs the write.

///
/// Every one of them is a `query` step, and every one of them reads the world exactly once through the kernel's
/// budgeted session: the enemy it is about is resolved through `TrySnapshot`, which is what charges the query
/// budget and proves the reference still names a life. The life state, behaviour `aiState` and position are read
/// from that snapshot. Type, tag and group add the domain-specific reads their contracts require, each against
/// the same life the snapshot just verified. The zone `where` answer comes from the
/// kernel's own zone read (`RuntimeQuerySession.TryZone`), which is the provider's registered
/// `EntityZones` responder and the only zone path this package has.
///
/// A value that cannot be read is a refusal with a code, never a zero and never an empty answer: a behaviour
/// state no `ai_state` member covers is `aiState == "disabled"` and is refused rather than reported as awake, and
/// a life whose type block does not read has no type (`enemy-type-unavailable`). A zone read that cannot be made
/// is a refusal of the same kind — an enemy the provider cannot place never arrives as an absent zone — so no port
/// in this family is nullable.
